I am a passionate developer and leader with 29 years of software development experience in roles
including Chief Technology Officer, VP of Engineering, Chief Architect, and Director of Mobile Development,
along with many years of hands-on development experience.

My skill-set ranges from business and management experience and knowledge to hands-on development expertise.
While at heart I will always be a developer, I am also passionate about innovation, growing and leading teams
and setting a technical vision for a company. I have a great deal of experience in the areas of full-stack
web development, mobile development and scalable architecture. I am also well versed in Agile methodologies.
</p>
<p>
I am also passionate about educating, mentoring, and building communities of practice. I have been an
evangelist for great software development in the Detroit area for many years. I am the founder and organizer of
the Technology Mentorship Community for Michigan. I also enjoy technical writing. I am the author of two published
books, the Java Phrasebook and the Ruby on Rails Bible.
