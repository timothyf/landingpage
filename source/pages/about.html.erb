        My skill-set ranges from business and management experience and knowledge to hands-on development expertise.
        While at heart I will always be a developer, I am also passionate about innovation, growing and leading teams
        and setting a technical vision for a company. I have a great deal of experience in the areas of full-stack
        web development, mobile development and scalable architecture. I am also well versed in Agile methodologies.

        evangelist for great software development in the Detroit area for many years. I am the founder and organizer of
        the Technology Mentorship Community for Michigan. I also enjoy technical writing. I am the author of two published
        books, the Java Phrasebook and the Ruby on Rails Bible.
